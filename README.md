# Bank OCR solution 

# Proof of Concept (POC) Overview

# Introduction
This documentation outlines the Proof of Concept (POC) for the application. It is important to note that this is not a finalized product but rather a demonstration of the concept's feasibility and potential.

# Purpose
The primary objective of this POC is to validate the core functionalities and features of the application. It serves as an initial exploration and experimentation phase to assess the viability of the proposed solution.

# Scope
The scope of the POC includes:

Identifying key requirements and objectives.
Implementing essential features to demonstrate functionality.
Gathering feedback and insights for future development.

# Notable Features
File Input: Ability to upload files containing data for processing.
Data Processing: Processing of uploaded data to extract relevant information.
OCR Integration: Integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction.
User Story Selection: Functionality to select different user stories to demonstrate various scenarios.
Account Display: Display of processed account data in a table.

# Limitations
The POC may not include all desired features and functionalities.
User interface design and aesthetics may be basic and not fully polished.
Error handling and edge cases may not be fully implemented.
Performance optimizations and scalability considerations may be limited.
Additional work is needed for implementing unit tests and test automation.
Detailed system requirements and corresponding test scenarios are missing.
Developer documentation, including code documentation and guidelines, is not available.
Error handling mechanisms for handling unexpected failures and exceptions need improvement.

# Improvement Opportunities
User Authentication: Implementing user authentication features to secure access to the application and user data.
Save Edited Data: Adding functionality to save edited data to persist changes made by users.
Multilingual Interface: Enhancing the user experience by providing support for multiple languages in the interface.
User Documentation: Creating comprehensive user documentation to guide users on how to use the application effectively.


# Usage

Open [Bank OCR](http://kviksite.com/bank-ocr/) to view it in your browser.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build:prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
The application home page can be set in package.json file.


# Conclusion
The POC serves as a foundational step in the development process, providing valuable insights and validation of the proposed solution. Further iterations and enhancements will be based on the feedback and outcomes of this phase.
